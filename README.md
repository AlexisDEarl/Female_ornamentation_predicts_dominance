Abstract: 
Males often exhibit elaborate ornamentation that contributes to their fitness. Similarly, females can also exhibit elaborate ornamentation, but we have a relatively limited understanding of its function. Recent studies have demonstrated that female ornamentation can function in both intrasexual competition and male mate choice, but few studies have been conducted on lekking species. We therefore investigated the possibility that female ornamentation provides information about the dominance status of the bearer, which could mediate intrasexual competition. We examined this possibility using Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), a sexually dimorphic lekking species in which females exhibit elaborate ornamentation in the form of iridescent green neck plumage. We tested whether female ornamentation predicts dominance status using an information theoretic model averaging approach. We found that females with brighter ornamentation are more socially dominant than females with darker ornamentation. These results suggest that female ornamentation in this species provides social information about the dominance status of the bearer. This study provides insight into the evolution of conspicuous female traits by suggesting a potential role for female ornamentation in intrasexual competition in a lekking species.
